        queue, str. The name of the queue to submit the jobs to. If None is given the current desi_proc default is used.
        reservation: str. The reservation to submit jobs to. If None, it is not submitted to a reservation.
        strictly_successful, bool. Whether all jobs require all inputs to have succeeded. For daily processing, this is
                                   less desirable because e.g. the sciences can run with SVN default calibrations rather
                                   than failing completely from failed calibrations. Default is False.
    Returns:
        ptable, Table, Processing table of all exposures that have been processed.
        arcjob, Table.Row or None, the psfnight job row if it exists. Otherwise None.
        flatjob, Table.Row or None, the nightlyflat job row if it exists. Otherwise None.
        sciences, list of Table.Row's, list of the most recent individual prestdstar science exposures
                                       (if currently processing that tile). May be empty if none identified yet or
                                       we just submitted them for processing.
        internal_id, int, if no job is submitted, this is the same as the input, otherwise it is incremented upward from
                          from the input such that it represents the smallest unused ID.
